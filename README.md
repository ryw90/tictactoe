tictactoe
=========

Command line tic-tac-toe with arbitrary rules, including:
* Arbitrary board size (m x n)
* Arbitrary number of players
* Arbitrary winning criteria (i.e. number of pieces to connect)

Thinking about whether this would still be a fun game in... arbitrary dimensions!? Probably depends on all the other rules...

Can be run with simply `python ttc.py`
